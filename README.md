## About

This is a project started as part of 
[CTC21: Put Your City on the Map](https://github.com/CodeTheCity/CTC21) and continued in [CTC22: The Environment](https://github.com/CodeTheCity/CTC22).

The aim is to provide Councils and citizens with a shared Open Data source of information about Council-run recycling options in their area.

We believe that there is a need for a custom UI for editing and display of the data, focussed on the subject. The generic editing facilities of OpenStreetMap and Wikidata could be used by data experts but are too generic for the general public and Councils.

This web app uses data from OpenStreetMap to display recycling centre locations, their accepted  materials, materials specifically banned, and opening hours.
